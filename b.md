# Introduction

Numerical expressions are vastly used in the field of data science. They are used to perform mathematical operations on data. However sometimes, the results of these operations are not as expected. This is because of the way computers store numbers and perform operations on them. This blog will help you understand how these operations are performed and how to avoid errors.
